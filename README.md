To run the neural network program, ensure you have the NVDA.csv in the same folder as the file you will run. In this case, the file you should run is the testNeuralNet.py

Also ensure you have all the python libraries installed, you can find the required ones in the dependency.txt file.

The openAI version of the testNeuralNet is still a WIP, we may use an openAI account to access the API to be able to use better NLP and train the API based on our data, this will make sure most of the grunt work of creating an NLP is already done by piggybacking off of openAI's research and programs.
